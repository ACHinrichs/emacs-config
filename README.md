# emacs-config
Simply put the .emacs file into your home-directory, or create a
hard-link.

# runemacsclient
If you are using Ubuntu (possibly works with other distros, but I have
not tested) copy `runemacsclient` and the image to `usr/local/bin/`
and the `.desktop`-file to `/usr/share/applications/`
