# emacs-config
This is my personal `.emacs.d`-directory, and some other usefull
things (located in /usefull) like a linux `.desktop` file to run
emacsclient


## Installation
Clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d` (or create a hardlink) to use the
configuration. The gitignore should exclude everything ›personal‹ from
commits, but if you want to contribute to this repo, be sure to check
the files before you `git add .` :grin:.

For the other usefull things I commited, see the sectios below.

## runemacsclient
If you are using Ubuntu (possibly works with other distros, but I have
not tested) copy `runemacsclient` and the image to `usr/local/bin/`
and the `.desktop`-file to `/usr/share/applications/`
